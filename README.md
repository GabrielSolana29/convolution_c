# convolution_c
Description:

C implementation of convolution operation with a two dimensional kernel. There are three available kernels: a randomly generated filter, a Low Pass Filter, and a Laplacian filter. When executing the code, a gray scale image, and a filtered image with the selected kernel will be saved in the project folder as a .png file. 

The CUDA implementation of the code is available too. The file main_cuda_program.cu contains the code for executing the CUDA program. The images are available as .txt files in the folder txt_files. The parameters that can be given through the console are the selection of the device, the selection of the image, and the selection of the kernel.

Instructions:

Downolad the zip file of the project. Copy all the files from the folders "Library" and Images in to the main folder. Open the main.c file, compile and run the program.

For the CUDA implementation: Download the zip file of the project. Extract the files from the txt folder, and palce them in the same directory as the main_cuda_program.cu
